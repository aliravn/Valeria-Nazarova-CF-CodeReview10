Project structure:

    <story TBA>
    
2) DB-development (exported as PDF files);
- cr10_valeria_nazarova_carrental_step1.pdf
- cr10_valeria_nazarova_carrental_step2.pdf
- cr10_valeria_nazarova_carrental_step3.pdf
database have been optimized up to certain extend during 3 steps, 
so I have decided to drop the 4th step as it would result in producing even more tables, 
and that was not the goal of the project =^_^=

3) mySQL database (exported as SQL file);
create DB with defined name (cr10_john_doe_carrental.sql)
create table for each entity
assign the relations between entities
create dummy-data based on diagram
fill-in the data
 
4) create 5 different queries (exported as SQL file);
write the question
write the query
write the result for checking or comments on what should it return, number of rows etc
exactly as in the classwork
